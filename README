Project 4

This project implements a simple, unbuffered TCP file transfer application
with a limit of 100KB / file. Make the server and client programs by:
    make all

The client may be run with:
    ./mycloudclient ServerName TCPport SecretKey

The server may be run with:
    ./mycloudserver TCPport SecretKey

The program accepts all commands as per the specification for cp, rm, list,
and quit. The program does not exit if too many arguments are provided to
a command. The program does not exit on a failed command, but continues to 
prompt the user for commands.

usage:
    cp c:cloudfile localfile
    cp localfile c:cloudfile
    cp c:cloudfile c:cloudfile
    cp localfile localfile 
    
    rm c:cloudfile
    rm localfile
     
    list

    done (exit, or ctrl-D)

Originally I had planned to write the program using structs for each
message, but I did not. I was concerned that gcc would change the 
order of the data members of the structs and I would get malformed 
data.
